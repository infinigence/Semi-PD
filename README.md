# Semi-PD
A prefill & decode disaggregated LLM serving framework with shared GPU memory and fine-grained compute isolation.

# Acknowledgment
This repository originally started as a fork of the SGLang project. Semi-PD is a research prototype and does not have complete feature parity with open-source SGLang. We have only retained the most critical features and adopted the codebase for faster research iterations.
